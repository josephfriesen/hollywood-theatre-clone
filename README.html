<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>This site is an exercise in replicating the design used by the Hollywood Theatre&#39;s web site, <a href="https://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/">https://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/</a>. The page contains a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page, with each option having a dropdown menu that appears on click, a main content body with info on each movie showing at the theatre today with showtimes and dummy links to purchase tickets, further informational panels below, and finally a page footer with dummy links to the rest of the site.</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>User can enter their name, address and phone number for the purposes of making a (simulated) pizza delivery. The site will take the user&#39;s name and print it in the sign-off greeting below.</p>
</li>
<li><p>User can add as many pizzas as they wish to their order, one at a time. Each pizza has three choices for size, three choices for crust style, and can have up to 8 toppings, all of which affects the final cost of that pizza.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As each pizza is added to the order, the information for that pizza is then added to an order summary panel below, listing size, crust, toppings, and price.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, when the user submits their final order, the order form is hidden on the page and a sign-off is revealed, showing the user&#39;s name, the total cost of their order, and some <em>very</em> sharp looking pizza clip art.</p>
