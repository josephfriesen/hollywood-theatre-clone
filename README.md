## Description

This site is an exercise in replicating the design used by the Hollywood Theatre's web site, https://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/. The page contains a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page, with each option having a dropdown menu that appears on click, a main content body with info on each movie showing at the theatre today with showtimes and dummy links to purchase tickets, further informational panels below, and finally a page footer with dummy links to the rest of the site.

## Specifications

* User can enter their name, address and phone number for the purposes of making a (simulated) pizza delivery. The site will take the user's name and print it in the sign-off greeting below.

* User can add as many pizzas as they wish to their order, one at a time. Each pizza has three choices for size, three choices for crust style, and can have up to 8 toppings, all of which affects the final cost of that pizza.

* As each pizza is added to the order, the information for that pizza is then added to an order summary panel below, listing size, crust, toppings, and price.

* Finally, when the user submits their final order, the order form is hidden on the page and a sign-off is revealed, showing the user's name, the total cost of their order, and some _very_ sharp looking pizza clip art.
