## Description

This site is an exercise in replicating the design used by the Hollywood Theatre's web site, https://www.hollywoodtheatre.org/. The page contains a fixed navigation bar at the top of the page, with each option having a dropdown menu that appears on click, a main content body with info on each movie showing at the theatre today with showtimes and dummy links to purchase tickets, further informational panels below, and finally a page footer with dummy links to the rest of the site.
